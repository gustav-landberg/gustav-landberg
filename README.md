# Hi there, I'm Gustav Landberg

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm currently studying a five year programme in Information and Communication Engineering at KTH.
I have a passion for all things low-level, whether that be systems programming in a language like C or Rust, or developing networked applications.
I also have a strong interest in cybersecurity and spend part of my free time playing Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, currently focusing on reverse engineering challenges.
## ðŸ”¥ Projects
Here is a selection of some of the projects I've been working on, both in my studies and in my free time:

- **Menumatic**: Menumatic-app: A mealplan suggestion service inspired by dating apps. In this project I worked on a Spring boot API server and a PostgreSQL database.

More coming soon!

### ðŸ’» Currently working on:
An emulator in Rust, which I may choose to publish on my profile in the future.
